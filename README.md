# chladni_plates

This MATLAB script simulates the movement of a 2-dimensional fixed membrane according to a simplified solution of the following equation: <br>
$\dfrac{\partial^2u}{\partial t^2} = v^2(\dfrac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2}+\dfrac{\partial^2u}{\partial y^2})$

Download the .mlx file for an interactive simulation, where you can change the value of the constants to generate different Chladni patterns.
